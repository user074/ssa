        "This is a quick start guide for starting training the SSA RL version. Because of the VRAM limitation, we use the Qwen2.5-0.5B model. It would still require 40GB A100 on colab. In addition, for the demo purpose, we set the data shuffle to False so it can just run some steps for GSM8K, which is much shorter than MATH solutions. Please set it back to True during actual training! And in that case you might need a GPU with more VRAM (probbaly 48GB+). Because the MATH solutions are longer, it increases the VRAM usage that 40GB A100 will have OOM."

User: Question: Grandpa Lou enjoys watching movies on the Hallmark channel, where every movie lasts 90 minutes.  If, on Tuesday, he watched several full-length movies on the Hallmark channel for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes, and then on Wednesday he watched on the same channel twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday.

            "First, let's determine how many full-length movies Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday. Each movie lasts 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Tuesday, he watched movies for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes, which is 4.5 hours.\n",

            "\\]\n",
            "\n",
            "On Wednesday, he watched twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of movies he watched on Wednesday is:\n",

            "\\]\n",

User: Question: Conner has a dune buggy that he rides in the desert.  On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour.  When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.  And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?\n",
